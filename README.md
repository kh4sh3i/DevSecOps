## ðŸ”© Tools 
Spending a lot of time on applying DevSecOps is searching, comparing, and making decisions about tools. These tool lists are a good way to help you reduce unnecessary time and apply them quickly :sunglasses:

# Tooling

## Pre-commit time tools

In this section you can find lifecycle helpers, precommit hook tools and threat modeling tools. Threat modeling tools are specific category by themselves allowing you to simulate and discover potential gaps before you start to develop the software or during the process.

Modern DevSecOps tools allow using Threat modeling as code or generation of threat models based on the existing code annotations.

## OSS and Dependency management

Dependency security testing and analysis is very important part of discovering supply chain attacks. SBOM creation and following dependency scanning (Software composition analysis) is critical part of continuous integration (CI). Data series and data trends tracking should be part of CI tooling. You need to know what you produce and what you consume in context of libraries and packages.

## Supply chain specific tools 

Supply chain is often the target of attacks. Which libraries you use can have a massive impact on security of the final product (artifacts). CI (continuous integration) must be monitored inside the tasks and jobs in pipeline steps. Integrity checks must be stored out of the system and in ideal case several validation runs with comparison of integrity hashes / or attestation must be performed.

## DAST

Dynamic application security testing (DAST) is a type of application testing (in most cases web) that checks your application from the outside by active communication and analysis of the responses based on injected inputs. DAST tools rely on inputs and outputs to operate. A DAST tool uses these to check for security problems while the software is actually running and is actively deployed on the server (or serverless function).

Policy as code is the idea of writing code in a high-level language to manage and automate policies. By representing policies as code in text files, proven software development best practices can be adopted such as version control, automated testing, and automated deployment.
